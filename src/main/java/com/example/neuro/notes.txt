- default value is assgined to property directly as setting columnDefinition is vendor dependent
- we won't allow null in ULID of master table as we are assigning it initially



Remaining :
- Linked is FK of ULID
- IDS name, Insert in master table
- transaction date in payment table
- validity list insertion multiple times(UK)
